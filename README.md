## Project Description

BZN is a web-app that utilizes an API to feed relevent political news 24/7. Left-wing and right-wing news outlets are separated by a "buffer zone". This middleground will contain relevant news from unbiased, or moderate, news sources. BZN is strictly American political news and American govenment news.

## Code Snippet

This for-loop automatically runs through the available data and appends the proper 
network name, image and headline to the page. Everytime theres a new article out, and someone
uses the page, new data is automatically appended to the page.

```
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++){
      const leftPotusSec = document.querySelector("#left-potus")
      let left = leftPotus.data.articles
      const h2 = document.createElement('h2')
      const p = document.createElement('p')
      const img = document.createElement('img')
      const a = document.createElement('a')
      const article = document.createElement('article')
      img.src = left[i].urlToImage
      let network = left[i].source.name
      let title = left[i].title
      a.href = left[i].url
      a.textContent = "Click here to read the full article"
      a.target = "_blank"
      h2.textContent = network
      p.textContent = title
      article.append(h2)
      article.append(img)
      article.append(p)
      article.append(a)
      leftPotusSec.append(article)
      a.textContent = "Click here to read the full article"
      a.target = "_blank"
      p.textContent = title
        }
```
