# Project Overview

## Buffer Zone News Aggregator

The name of your project with deployed URL.

## Project Description

BZN is a web-app that utilizes an API to feed relevent news 24/7. Left-wing and right-wing news outlets are separated by a "buffer zone". This middleground will contain relevant news from unbiased, or moderate, news sources. BZN is strictly American political news and American govenment news.

## API and Data Sample
### News API
https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?domains=cnn.com&foxnews.com&sortBy=publishedAt&language=en&apiKey=90227dcd441a4362b5c3669eb2b7e229

## Wireframes

### Main Page with limited amount of stories for each category
https://git.generalassemb.ly/justinknuth/bzn/blob/master/assets/wireframe%20main%20page.png

### A category page with relevant stories up to a certain amount. There will be 4 categories so 4 layouts of this kind.

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|Feb 22-23| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Incomplete
|Feb 23| Project Approval | Incomplete
|Feb 24| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|Feb 24| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|Feb 25| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|Feb 26| MVP | Incomplete
|March 1| Presentations | Incomplete

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | 3hrs | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Structuring Page | 1.5hrs | 
| Styling Page | 2hrs |
