#### URL - 

## Project Description

BZN is a web-app that utilizes an API to feed relevent political news 24/7. Left-wing and right-wing news outlets are separated by a "buffer zone". This middleground will contain relevant news from unbiased, or moderate, news sources. BZN is strictly American political news and American govenment news.
