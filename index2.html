      <p>BZN was created to give users the ability to see their news from every angle.
        Using a generalized political spectrum, political news is placed into one of three columns.
        The left column represents liberal, or progressive news. The center columnn if or those news networks
        that may be considered un-biased, or moderate. The right column is reserved for conservative news outlets.
        One intent of BZN is to highlight media bias when it exists. Though bias is not always present, it is most certainly
        out there.<br><br>
        Absolutely no political bias was involved in the making of BZN.<br><br>
        BZN is strictly American Government news.
